# mnist_classification

This is one of the projects I work on as I follow Aurelien Geron's Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow, Copyright 2019 Aurélien Géron, 978-1-492-03264-9. You can get yourself a copy of the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291).

This project looks at the a supervised learning task, classification. MNIST data on various digits are examined to correctly predict the right number. Many types of classification, including single binary, multiclass, multilabel and multioutput classifications are examined.
